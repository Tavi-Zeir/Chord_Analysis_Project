# Chord_Analysis_Project

Using data from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eitanbentora/chords-and-lyrics-dataset

The goal of this project is to analyze the frequency of various chord progressions, by genre and by artist.
The dataset is from a web scrape of user submitted lyrics/chords pages on e-chords.com, so natually it is very messy.
Early efforts have been focused on getting the chord data into a usable form.
